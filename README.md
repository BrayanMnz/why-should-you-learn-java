# Why should you learn java 

This repository houses the examples for the [**Why Should You Learn Java**](https://github.com/BrayanMnz/why-should-you-learn-java/blob/java16+/WhyShouldYouLearnJava_Barcamp_es.pdf) talk that took place on the [BarcampRD 2023](barcamp.org.do). 

The content for this presentation was mainly designed by Ken Fogel, and the Java In Education Working Group led by [JCP](jcp.org) to learn more about this Java In Education initiativego to the [JCP, Java in education section](https://jcp.org/java-in-education).

#### Requirements

- Java 21 -  if you want to start testing and using the Unnamed Classes and Instance Main method approach like I'm doing it for most of the examples in [**java16+**](https://github.com/BrayanMnz/why-should-you-learn-java/tree/java16+/) branch
    
    - If you are using an IDE, please enable the preview features option.
    - If you are running it manually, please remember to enable the preview features with: 
       ```
       java --enable-preview --source 21 TargetClass.java
       ```

- Java 16+ - You need, at least Java 16 to run all the examples across the multiple directories. If you want to use this approach, please move to the java16+ branch if not, you will get some errors related to the usage of instance main methods and unnamed classes. 


#### Structure 

The repository structure is pretty simple, we have seven directories starting from _example-0_ to _example-6_ that contains the examples used within the presentation. 

0. [example-0](https://github.com/BrayanMnz/why-should-you-learn-java/tree/java16+/example-0) - Contains the resources for the JShell example. 
1. [example-1](https://github.com/BrayanMnz/why-should-you-learn-java/tree/java16+/example-1) - Contains the resources for the Single-File Source-Code programs, and the SheBang script.
2. [example-2](https://github.com/BrayanMnz/why-should-you-learn-java/tree/java16+/example-2) - Contains the resources for the _Local variable type inference **var**_ example.
3. [example-3](https://github.com/BrayanMnz/why-should-you-learn-java/tree/java16+/example-3) - Contains the resources for the _Text Block_ example.  
4. [example-4](https://github.com/BrayanMnz/why-should-you-learn-java/tree/java16+/example-4) - Contains the resources for the _Switch case_ example.
